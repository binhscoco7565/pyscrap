# pyscrap

PyScrap is a user-friendly, fast and lightweight python script that will allow you to scrape off some content or all content from the web. It uses the simple BeautifulSoup library that allows it to be fast and efficient. I'm still learning so don't kill me for any mistakes!

## Usage

Get requests
`pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`
Get BeautifulSoup4
`pip install bs4` or `pip3 install bs4`
